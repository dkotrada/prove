# Motivation
This project is designed as a showcase to demonstrate modern technologies, patterns, and best practices in software architecture, making it a practical reference for teams and individuals interested in modular Spring development.

Spring Modulith is used in the project to enable a clean, modular architecture that combines the simplicity of a monolith with strong boundaries and maintainability between business modules. It helps organize code by domains, improves testability, allows easier refactoring, and prepares the application for possible future migration to microservicesâ€”without introducing the complexity of a distributed system too early.
